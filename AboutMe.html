								<p> Hey, I’m Sully! My legal name is a mouthful, so I keep it simple. I come from a unique background I spent years working my way up from deckhand to yacht captain in NYC Harbor,
								a role that demanded discipline, problem solving, and quick decision making. <br> But I’ve always been drawn to technology, so I made the leap into IT and software development.
								Now, I’m a full time student at SUNY Buffalo State University, majoring in Computer Information Systems, while also working as an IT technician. 
								I’ve built web apps, automated processes with PowerShell, and have hands on experience with front end development, databases, and scripting. <br> 
								I’m driven by the challenge of solving real world problems with technology, and I’m always looking to learn and grow in this field.
								I’m excited to apply my technical skills and problem solving mindset to a team where I can make an impact!
								</p>
